In 2016 I embarked on a successful journey to completing both of these certificates. At the time the internet was flooded with questions asking which is better and which should I pursue. While at the time I never publicly gave my answer; when my fellow colleague would ask I would respond something like this. 

OSCP is an exam where you get very little help (we will discuss more on that in a bit later), you also get very little way in resources (usually at this point you see the nods go to a slight look of disappointment), however the lab environment was one of the best I had seen at the time (especially as I was working as a Network Engineer and a Programmer at the time. The lab allows you plenty of options for trying out different tools and techniques, many you might not even need to pass the final exam, however you get access to a pretty realistic network. 

The OSCP staff will guide you by giving you hints, but not answers and quite frequently you will be banging your head against a wall (sometimes literally) however the learning experience and sense of accomplishment from completing the OSCP is beyond anything else. 

The exam is a grueling 48 hours and you need to attack 5 machines in isolation in order to accrue points. Pass a certain amount of points and provide a good enough report and you pass OSCP. 

The eLearnsecurity PTP however was in many ways the opposite of this. The training was very comprehensive (maybe not as advanced as some of the OSCP material but a lot more thorough throughout). I felt it was rather beginner friendly, and having read through the PTP documentation following completion of OSCP it rather felt like it was spoon feeding students and maybe not encouraging as much research and self development. 

The labs and the exams were a complete juxtaposition compred to the OSCP. Instead of having a lab to practice various techniques 24/7 you would get alloted lab time and you would spin up individual exercies and complete them in isolation. The exam on the other hand was more similiar to a real world pentest, no more individual machines, you connect to a VPN and you now have to find the end goal, pivoting through subnets, performing pinhole surgery attacks and chaining together skills to get you to your end goal.

So which is better? Well the purpose of this post is not to actually answer the question of which is better as both of these exams have now been updated. I recently renewed my OSCP training materials to see over 5 times the amount of training materials I had as a pupil in 2016 and as you know <a class="hover-link" target="_blank" href="https://evilsaint.co.uk/blog/elearnsecurity-new-learning-platform">eLearnSecurity new learning platform</a> I have recently joined the new elearnsecurity training platform. So while I could sit and write about the differences between the courses and exams in 2016, my actual plan is to review the new and revamped courses released this year. 

Stay tuned for part 2 of this article.
