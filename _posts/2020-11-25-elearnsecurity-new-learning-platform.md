As a multiple elearnsecurity certification holder I recently received and email inviting me to try out a Beta test of their new training platform.  Upon opening the email I was quite surprised that the training platform wasn't hosted on elearnsecurity and instead it was hosted on ine.com. 

"Where had I seen or heard that name before?", then it hit me! I had been looking at ine.com back when I was thinking about pursuing my CCIE; nearly all network engineers I knew at that time had suggested they had the best CCIE training! but what had this to do with elearnsecurity?

It turns out that elearnsecurity wanted to focus on becoming a certification body and so while focusing its attention on doing just that, it has passed over all training to ine.com to take care of. Considering the old price of some of the training that elearnsecurity used to provide, it could cost anywhere up to $2000 to complete a single certificate the new model has made certification very affordable. 

## The new model

In short the new model is; you can go to elearnsecurity and buy an exam voucher for any exam and if you feel like you are ready to take the exam you can book it in with no pre-requisites or additional fees needed (N.B. a typical exam attempt voucher will cost you $400). If however you require training then you can sign up for an ine.com subscription. INE content is split into 4 categories, Cloud, Networking, Data and CyberSecurity. The three former categories are available on a monthly or yearly basis however the CyberSecurity is only available as a yearly subscription.  

## My Decision

Up until a week ago I was debating on whether to "go for it" with regards to ine.com subscription as I had just recently purchased a place on <a class="hover-link" target="_blank" href="https://evilsaint.co.uk/blog/cqure-academy-advanced-windows-security-course-2021">Cquer Academy: Advanced Windows Security Course 2021</a> the Advanced Windows Security course by CQure and was ruminating over taking the new Crack the Perimeter replacement course by Offensive Security (the OSEP). That was until I received a Black Friday discount email of 40% of the yearly price! for just $1199, down from $1999, I would be able to complete all elearnsecurity training courses (assuming I finish them within the year - the length of my training subscription). Without hesitation I signed up and from this point the "Game is on!". 

This blog post, similar to the <a class="hover-link" target="_blank" href="https://evilsaint.co.uk/blog/cqure-academy-advanced-windows-security-course-2021">Cquer Academy: Advanced Windows Security Course 2021</a>, will be my ongoing review of my experience with ine.com and the elearnsecurity certification process over the next year.  Let‚Äôs see how many courses I can complete üòè
