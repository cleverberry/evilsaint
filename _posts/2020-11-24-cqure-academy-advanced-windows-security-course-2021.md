For those of you who follow the  <a class="hover-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheEvilSaint">EvilSaint Facebook account</a>, will know that today was the start of the Cqure Academy Advanced Windows Security course I signed up for. I will be looking to review the course from start to finish and this blog marks the beginning of a six-week ongoing review of the course as the course progresses.

First some background on the course. The course is taught over a six-week duration and divided into 12 modules, it is aimed at cyber security professionals on both the offensive and defensive side and its coverage is limited to Microsoft and Windows.

The course teaching is delivered via a Thinkific training platform and Zoom, however there are additional resources such as a private Facebook group where it is possible to converse with other people on the course and share knowledge and ideas in addition to a training environment where you can practice the attacks discussed in the lectures.

> Currently I do not have access to the training labs. Not sure if this is to be provided at a later date or I have missed an email or potentially some part of the video content. I will update on this in part two.

## Why take this course??

One of the things that drew my interest to this course was the fact that it was limited to only 200 students and only happens one time a year. Admittedly the fact it was labelled as an advanced course did also pique my interest. Having completed many IT related courses such as the CCNP by Cisco, the OSCP by offensive security and the WAPTx by elearnsecurity l wanted to see what would constitute as advanced :)

## The Setup

Before each video lesson, pre-requisite reading material is provided via the Thinkific learning portal so everyone can get up to speed prior to the lectures. This is a good idea as one of my pet peeves when paying for training is students that are way out of their depth and end up slowing down the rest of the class.

## My First Lesson

Tonight's session started at 6pm UK time. The lesson started fairly prompt, only a few minutes past the hour; I noticed a couple of moaning comments under the Facebook post advertising the start time in the private group, this was a 6:01pm, had to laugh, but hey l guess you get these types throughout all walks of life.

The session was okay, I wouldn’t say advanced however I guess it is all about perspectives and prior experience. This was the first session so a lot of introduction type content and housekeeping yet despite this I still picked up two new things that l didn’t know before the lesson which for me I felt was good value.

The instructors, Paula and Mike were up-beat and excited to be teaching the revamped curriculum, the Zoom platform was stable and with the exception of one person commenting in the chat the audio was crisp for everyone.

Unfortunately, the first demo that Paula attempted didn’t work as expected, possibly caused due to the Demo Gods not receiving a big enough sacrifice prior to lesson commencement. When the demo didn’t work l had flashbacks to every to every demo I have given in my own private ethical hacking mentoring group that had ever gone wrong. Luckily, Paula was a pro and was prepared with screenshots, so we all understood the point of what was supposed to happen.

Mike walked us through some interesting paths of gaining footholds into companies infrastructure via employees working from home.  I really liked this approach; many courses show you individual attacks and typically step you through them in isolation. Mike guided us through a progressive group of attacks and techniques that could be chained together in a very realistic scenario. 

I am looking forward to the next session and depending on how this course progresses may do another Cqure academy course straight after this one.
