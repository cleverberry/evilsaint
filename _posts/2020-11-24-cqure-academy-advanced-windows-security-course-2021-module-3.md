Tonight's session certainly stepped it up a notch from module 2. This was my favourite module so far.  Frequent presenter Mike came back for this session but instead of Paula we were introduced to a new member of the Cqure team Milosz Piasecki. 

Topics covered in this were module were "Certificates and Public Key Infrastructure". 

Mike kicked things off with some background on the topic. Typically Cryptography and PKI can be quite a dry topic but I felt Mike covered the introduction to the topic well. 

We started off with the basics and defined a few terms that often get confused.

<ul>
<li>Encoding</li>
<li>Encryption</li>
<li>Hashing </li>
<li>Signing</li>
</ul>

We then moved to look at Asymetric and Symetric Encryption, we looked at the algorithms used and the mass behind them. Mikes gave good explanations on the mass behing and worked out and calculated examples for us to follow. 

This was a long section with Mike speaking for almost 1 hour and 20 minutes; we covered the differences bween asymetic and sysmetric encrption, dicussions on encoding and signing and a discussion about checksumbs, collision attacks and dual checksums found on system files.

Practics for this session looked at gaining admin rights by taking over writable certificate templates. 

This was my favourite module yet.
