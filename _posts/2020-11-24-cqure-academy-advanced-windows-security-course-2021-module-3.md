Tonight's session certainly stepped it up a notch from module 2. This was my favourite module so far.  Frequent presenter Mike came back for this session but instead of Paula we were introduced to a new member of the Cqure team Milosz Piasecki. 

Topics covered in this were module were "Certificates and Public Key Infrastructure". Mike kicked things off with some background on the topic. Typically, Cryptography and PKI lectures can be quite dry but I felt Mike covered the introduction to the topic well, I would probably go as far to say, that for the time spent to coverage gained this was probably the best lecture on the topic I have come across. Before my readership start declaring I have a man crush on Mike, let me go justify my opinion and explain what I liked about this lecture. 

We started off with the basics and defined a few terms that often get confused, Encoding, Encryption, Hashing, Signing and then we moved on to understanding the mathmatics behind Asymmetric Cryptography, we looked a Diffie-Hellman-Merkle key exchange and RSA. I really liked this, for agest I have understood the difference between aysemetric and symetric algorithms but had never taken the time to look into the maths behind them. 

With the basic theory understood we moved on to PKI Infrastructure, this section started out with a look at Digital Certificate 

<ul>
<li>Encoding</li>
<li>Encryption</li>
<li>Hashing </li>
<li>Signing</li>
</ul>

We then moved to look at Asymetric and Symetric Encryption, we looked at the algorithms used and the mass behind them. Mikes gave good explanations on the mass behing and worked out and calculated examples for us to follow. 

This was a long section with Mike speaking for almost 1 hour and 20 minutes; we covered the differences bween asymetic and sysmetric encrption, dicussions on encoding and signing and a discussion about checksumbs, collision attacks and dual checksums found on system files.

Practics for this session looked at gaining admin rights by taking over writable certificate templates. 

This was my favourite module yet.
